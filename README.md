## Portfolio Website - Next.js/ReactJS, Prisma ORM, tRPC and NextAuth

🌐 This project is a **Next.js** application created to serve as a portfolio website for my sister.

🔐 I have successfully implemented a login system using **NextAuth**.

🎨 Additionally, I have integrated interface elements to enable dynamic content editing. This is facilitated by **Prisma ORM**, allowing for efficient database interactions and data modeling.

🚀 Furthermore, these features have been implemented using **tRPC**, a framework for building type-safe APIs. This ensures robust communication between the front-end and back-end, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the application.
