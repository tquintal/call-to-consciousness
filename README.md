## Portfolio Website - Next.js/React

🌐 This project is a Next.js application created to serve as a portfolio website for my sister. It is currently under development.

🐦 Future plans involve implementing a login system using NextAuth and adding interface elements to enable dynamic content editing. Additionally, I intend to implement these features using TRPC and Prisma technologies.
