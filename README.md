## Portfolio Website - Next.js/React

This project is a Next.js application created to serve as a portfolio website for my sister. It is currently in its initial stage, featuring static content. However, please note that the content and structure are still under development, and the frontend is not yet completed.

Future plans include developing a backend and a CMS (Content Management System) to allow her to interact with and update the content.
