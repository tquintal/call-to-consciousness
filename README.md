- **Application Layer**: The application layer contains business logic and orchestrates interactions between the frontend and backend. It utilizes Next.js API routes and tRPC to define type-safe APIs for communication.
- **Data Access Layer**: Prisma ORM is used for interacting with the database, providing a type-safe and intuitive way to query and manipulate data. PostgreSQL is chosen as the database solution for its reliability and scalability.
- **Authentication and Authorization Layer**: Authentication is managed using NextAuth, supporting various authentication providers and ensuring secure access to the backoffice.
- **Styling and Animation Layer**: TailwindCSS is employed for styling the application, offering utility-first CSS classes for rapid UI development. Framer Motion is integrated for adding animations and transitions, enhancing the user experience.
